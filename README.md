### Hi there 👋

I'm an **Artificial Intellingence** enthusiast, with wide variety of **Machine Learning** knowledge under my belt (**NLP** & **CV** are my forte, but **GP**s and **Probabilistic Models** can also be handled), and moderate **Full Stack** skills. I mostly speak **Python**, but **JS** & **C++** also goes. Looking for a challenging job in the field of AI/ML - don't hesitate to drop me a message if you have something available.
