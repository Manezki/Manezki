### Hi there 👋

I'm an **Artificial Intellingence** enthusiast, with wide variety of **Machine Learning** knowledge under my belt (**NLP** & **CV** are my forte, but **GP**s and **Probabilistic Models** can also be handled), and moderate **Full Stack** skills. I mostly speak **Python** and **Go**, but **JS**, **C++** nor **Rust** make me shy. Are you working on interesting challenges within AI/ML? - I might be interested to help, so [drop me a line](#📫-how-to-reach-me).
